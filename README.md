# HPCinstall

## Goal and Vision

`HPCinstall` is a piece of software to be used to install other software. Its goals are:

1. Not being in your way (as much as possible) allowing you to do whatever you want
2. Nudge you (but not force you) towards some best practices which we agreed upon
3. Help you by automatically making the stupid, clerical, tedious tasks that you know you need to do, but don't have time and will to

Some of the best practices we agree that we should be doing and that `HPCinstall` tries to nudge you towards are:

 a. Make the install process easily reproducible, i.e. use a script file instead of typing commands at the prompt. A different approach is possible (similar to using the `script` typescript approach as described [here](stackoverflow.com/questions/5985060/5985255#5985255)) but that is not what `HPCinstall` takes.
 
 b. Set a couple of environmental variables to make the install script mentioned in a. independed from the particular version of the software you are installing
 
 c.

It is easier to show how it achieves these goals with an example
