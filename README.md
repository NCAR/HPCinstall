# HPCinstall

## Goal and Vision

HPCinstall is a piece of software to be used to install other software. Its goals are:

1. be as little as possible in your way, allowing you to do whatever you want
2. nudge you (but not force you) towards some best practices which we agreed upon (e.g. saving the install scripts, modules, and logs)
3. help you by automatically making the stupid, clerical, tedious tasks that you know you need to do, but don't have time and will to

It is easier to show how it achieves these goals with an example

## Sample use
